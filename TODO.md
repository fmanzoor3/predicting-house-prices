# TODO list

-[x] Aggregated the scraped data to have combined data

-[x] Format our scraped data so that it can be turned into a csv that we will be able to use in our data analysis

-[x] Collected all of our data scraping/csv writing into a data manager class

-[x] When webscraping if a property doesnt have a feature its not going to be mentioned in its info; account for this to say that those features are N/A [this happens automatically actually]

-[] Get selenium to enter each page, scrape the info and then after each listing on a page to go to the next page
